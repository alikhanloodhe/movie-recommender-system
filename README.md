# Movie Recommender System

This project is a Movie Recommender System that suggests similar movies based on a user’s selection. Using content-based filtering techniques, it recommends movies by analyzing metadata and calculating similarity scores between films.

## 📂 Dataset

Source: TMDB Movie Dataset on Kaggle

Description: Contains movie metadata including titles, genres, overviews, cast, crew, and more.

## 🧠 Implementation Details

Vectorization:

Used Count Vectorizer to convert movie metadata (tags) into a numerical vector representation.

## Similarity Calculation:

Calculated Cosine Similarity (from sklearn.metrics) between movie vectors to measure how closely related two movies are.

## Recommendation Engine:

For any selected movie, the system retrieves the top N similar movies using the similarity matrix.

## UI Interface:

Built an interactive Streamlit interface for users to input a movie name and get recommendations instantly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

##Libraries:

scikit-learn for vectorization & similarity calculation

pandas, numpy for data handling

streamlit for UI

matplotlib, seaborn (optional) for visualization

## 📊 Features

Content-Based Filtering: Uses movie metadata to recommend similar movies.

Interactive UI: Easy-to-use Streamlit app for real-time recommendations.

Customizable Recommendations: Adjust the number of movies recommended as per your preference.
